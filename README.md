## Tower Defense 2018 with OpenGL support

### Tower defense is a subgenre of strategy video game where the goal is to defend a player's territories or possessions by obstructing the enemy attackers, usually achieved by placing defensive structures on or along their path of attack.
### This typically means building a variety of different structures that serve to automatically block, impede, attack or destroy enemies. Tower defense is seen as a subgenre of real-time strategy video games, due to its real-time origins,[2][3] though many modern tower defense games include aspects of turn-based strategy.
### Strategic choice and positioning of defensive elements is an essential strategy of the genre.
